# 🚢 Ship Hydrostatics & Hull Modeling Project

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains a full technical project on **Naval Architecture**, focusing on 3D hull modeling and hydrostatic analysis. The project was completed as part of the Ship Hydrostatics course at **Sharif University of Technology** under the supervision of Dr. Khorasanchi.

> **Note:** The main technical reports and documents are in **Persian**, but the repository structure and brief descriptions are provided in English for international accessibility.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
* **Maxsurf Modeler:** Hull geometry and surface fairing.
* **Maxsurf Stability:** Hydrostatic calculations and Bonjean curves.
* **SolidWorks:** CAD modeling and 3D visualization.
* **MS Excel:** Data processing of offset tables and manual verification.

## 📊 Key Results
### 1. 3D Hull Modeling
The hull was developed using NURBS surfaces based on non-dimensional offset data.
