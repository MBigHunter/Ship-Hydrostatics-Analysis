# 🚢 Ship Hydrostatics & Hull Modeling Project

## 📝 Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive **Naval Architecture** project focused on the end-to-end process of ship hull design and hydrostatic evaluation. Developed at **Sharif University of Technology** under the supervision of **Dr. Khorasanchi**, this project bridges the gap between theoretical fluid statics and practical computer-aided design.

> **Note:** Technical reports are written in **Persian**, while the documentation and repository structure are maintained in **English** for global outreach.

## 🚀 Key Achievements
* **Geometric Transformation:** Converted non-dimensional offset tables into a precise 1:1 scale 3D model.
* **Surface Fairing:** Achieved a high-quality NURBS surface hull in Maxsurf with smooth curvature distribution.
* **Integrity Verification:** Cross-validated software-generated hydrostatic data with manual Excel-based mathematical models.
* **Stability Profiling:** Conducted full intact stability analysis and generated Bonjean curves for longitudinal strength assessment.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
* **Maxsurf Modeler & Stability:** 3D Surface modeling & Hydrostatic analysis.
* **SolidWorks:** Mechanical CAD design and .STEP export.
* **MS Excel:** Advanced data processing and numerical verification.
